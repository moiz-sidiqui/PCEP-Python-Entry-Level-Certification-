    "3. Most used integer literals in Python consist of a sequence of decimal digits. Such a sequence cannot include white spaces, but can contain any number of _ (underscore) characters. Note: there must not be more than one underscore between two digits, and the underscore must be neither the last nor the first character of the literal. Underscores don't change a literal's value, and their only role is to improve literal readability. Integer literals can be preceded by any number of - (minus) or + (plus) characters, which are applied to set the literal's sign."
