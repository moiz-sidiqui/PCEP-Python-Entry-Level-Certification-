    "1. An exception is an event caused by an execution error which can induce program termination if not properly handled by the programmer. The situation in which the exception is created and propagated is called raising the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Python professes its philosophy expressed with the sentence: It's better to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission. The recommendation hidden behind these words says that the programmer should allow the exceptions to occur and handle them properly instead of persistently avoiding problems and protecting the code from all possible errors with all their might.\n",

    "3. To control exceptions and to handle them, Python provides a dedicated construction consisting of the try and except branches.\n",

    "4. The try block encloses a part of the code that may cause an exception and when it happens, the execution of the block is terminated and the control jumps into the except block, which is dedicated to recognizing the problem and handling it. For example, the following snippet prints PROCEEDING even though the code provokes division by zero:"
